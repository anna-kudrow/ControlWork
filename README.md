##Hello!
In the .md file you can see my history from linux terminal where I worked with 'cat' commands.
Also in my .sql file you can see my script according the task. 
Also there is a file with a diagramm where I made an animal hierarchy. 
Also there is a java programm where I work on a small register system for several types of animals.
